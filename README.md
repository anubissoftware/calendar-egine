# Calendar library

Calendar is developed by Anubis Software S.A.S. 

## How to use it?

It's only required to import the Wrapper component

`import { Wrapper } from 'calendar-engine'`

The Wrapper component is ready to render the full calendar in English. The calendar Wrapper also emits some events to register new events or update any existing event. 

Calendar also has Composables to add previous registered events and modify the calendar behavior.

* `useEventStorage`

**Calendar is still on development**
